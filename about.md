I'm Rob, AI Engineer based in Manchester and currently working for [mindtrace.ai](http://mindtrace.ai).

When I find the time I like to write short blogs about projects that I am proud of or sometimes it can help to better understand an algorithm by writing about it. I also enjoy DIY projects and cycling. 

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to find out more about me.
